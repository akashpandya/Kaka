Made use of React states and React hooks as well as third-party form applications
and Api integration to create add to calendar functionality.
Created a fully functional web app with the ability to subscribe to a newsletter, leave
messages and book events in your personal calendar so that the client doesnâ€™t miss any
important get-togethers and can interact with the NGO as they see fit.
